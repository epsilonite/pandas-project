## Overview: 
Relationship between rainfall timing and volume vs fires and damage / acreage spread, and see if there are direct human contributions, ie. type of ignition source and proximity to infrastructure (powerlines, highways, political regions, fire fighting infrastructure)
### Initial Questions: 
Is there a correlation between the length of fire season and rainy season?  Is there a correlation between density of rainfall and density of fire season?
- Duration of overall fire season
- Average duration per county
- Pull fire data by acreage: Find sum area damaged by wildfire and compare to difference in rainfall compared to historic average for at least 3 yrs (as far as data allows)
- Look at rainfall (beginning, end and monthly density ) and compare to fire season (beginning, end and monthly density) for at least 3 yrs (as far as data allows)
Does ignition source influence the beginning and end of fire season?
- Cause (natural, manmade, etc)
- Average duration per cause/incident
- Average acreage spread per cause 
- Look at human infrastructure layers
